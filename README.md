# ORIE 4741 Final Project

**Project Name**: CrimeTime

**Team members**:
- Brendan Kirsh (bjk99)
- Sudeshna Pontula (slp256)
- Dylan Tsai (dt439)

**Purpose**: We will examine crime data from multiple major cities to determine trends in serious crimes over time. Our dataset consists of complaints/police reports from major U.S. cities spanning the years 2015-2018. Since public police reports generally include time data on when incidents have occurred, this gives us sufficient information to form a machine learning model that uses time-based predictions, which would provide a less biased estimate of when police departments should increase security in their typical patrol areas.
